# Flet Beginner Course for Game Development

## [Flet 1.0 Python for Beginners Course Overview (Learn Python by Building Games)](https://youtu.be/F2f98GhkKUA)

Start of tutorial series on Flet Python games. Covers getting free sprite graphics for games, using 4 degrees of movement.

This video introduces a beginner-friendly Python tutorial series where the primary goal is to learn Python fundamentals, using Flet 1.0 to make the learning process more visual and engaging.

Instead of starting with abstract examples, we build a very simple, game-like application entirely in Python. We use character graphics inspired by the Pepper & Carrot comic (sourced from OpenGameArt with proper attribution) to make the experience more fun and concrete—especially for learners who benefit from visual feedback.

This first video is a preview and orientation. It shows how assets are prepared, how sprites are positioned on screen, and how Python code controls movement and animation. The actual step-by-step coding begins in the next videos.

What this series focuses on:

Learning core Python concepts through hands-on practice
Using Flet 1.0 as a lightweight UI framework (no Dart or Flutter required)
Working with images, coordinates, and simple animations

Practicing modern Python features such as:

- dataclasses
- state stored in objects
- observable / reactive updates
- Understanding how UI state changes trigger screen updates

What this series is not:

- It is not a full game development course
- It is not an advanced Flutter or Flet deep dive
- It is not optimized for production games

Instead, this series is designed as a low-friction way to practice Python while seeing immediate, visual results. Flet makes it possible to run the same Python code on Windows, macOS, Linux, web, and mobile, but portability is a bonus—not the main objective.

If you are new to Python, or you want a more engaging way to practice Python fundamentals, this series is a good place to start.
